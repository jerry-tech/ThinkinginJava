     *             <li>Exercise 1:   (2) Create a class containing an int and a char that are not initialized, and
     *                  print their values to verify that Java performs default initialization.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 2:  (1) Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a hello, world
     *                  program that simply displays that statement. You need only a single method in your class
     *                  (the main one that gets executed when the program starts). Remember to make it static and to
     *                  include the argument list, even though you do not use the argument list. Compile the program
     *                  with javac and run it using java. If you are using a different development environment than
     *                  the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 3:  (1) Find the code fragments involving ATypeName and turn them into a program that
     *                  compiles and runs.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 4:  (1) Turn the DataOnly code fragments into a program that compiles and runs.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 5:  (1) Modify the previous exercise so that the values of the data in DataOnly are
     *                  assigned to and printed in main( ).</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 6:  (2) Write a program that includes and calls the storage( ) method defined as a code
     *                  fragment in this chapter.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 7:  (1) Turn the Incrementable code fragments into a working program.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 8:  (3) Write a program that demonstrates that, no matter how many objects you create
     *                  of a particular class, there is only one instance of a particular static field in that
     *                  class.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 9:  (2) Write a program that demonstrates that autoboxing works for all the primitive
     *                  types and their wrappers.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 10:    (2) Write a program that prints three arguments taken from the command line. To
     *                  do this, you will need to index into the command-line array of Strings.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 11:    (1) Turn the AllTheColorsOfTheRainbow example into a program that compiles and
     *                  runs.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 13:    (1) Run Documentation1.java, Documentation2.java, and Documentation3.java
     *                  through Javadoc. Verify the resulting documentation with your Web browser.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 14:    (1) Add an HTML list of items to the documentation in the previous exercise.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 15:    (1) Take the program in Exercise 2 and add comment documentation to it. Extract
     *                  this comment documentation into an HTML file using Javadoc and view it with your Web
     *                  browser.</li>
     *
     *             <li>Exercise 16:    (1) In the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, locate the Overloading.java example
     *                  and add Javadoc documentation. Extract this comment documentation into an HTML file using
     *                  Javadoc and view it with your Web  browser.</li>
