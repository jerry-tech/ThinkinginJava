//    Exercise 11: (7) In a real vending machine you will want to easily add and change the
//    type of vended items, so the limits imposed by an enum on Input are impractical
//            (remember that enums are for a restricted set of types). Modify VendingMachine.java so
//    that the vended items are represented by a class instead of being part of Input, and
//            initialize an Array List of these objects from a text file (using
//            net.mindview.util.TextFile).
